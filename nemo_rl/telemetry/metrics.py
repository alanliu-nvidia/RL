"""Best-effort mirroring of NeMo-RL's per-step metrics into OTel.

Kept out of ``nemo_rl.utils.logger`` (which pulls in torch/ray/wandb/etc.) so
the mapping stays importable and testable without the heavy training stack.
``nemo_rl.utils.logger.Logger.log_metrics`` calls :func:`tee_rl_metrics_to_otel`
after its normal fan-out to the file/wandb/mlflow backends.

Every series is declared here rather than in lens, via lens's consumer-driven
metric registry: NeMo-RL owns the ``rl.*`` metric names, so a new series needs
no lens release and no negotiation over field names. Four families are teed —
the async ``efficiency/*`` phase durations, the training scalars, the ``vllm/*``
engine deltas, and the ``timing/setup`` startup phases. The first three ride the
per-step ``train`` dicts; the last arrives once, at step 0.

``Logger.log_metrics`` fans a step out as several dicts under different
prefixes, and a key is only reachable from the prefix its own dict carries — so
only the prefixes those dicts actually arrive under are teed.
